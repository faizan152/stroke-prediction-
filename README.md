This is a project done on real world dataset collected from kaggle to predict stroke. 
After data processing and understanding the data in depth using EDA techniques, I trained the Random Forest Classifier model with the data.
There was class imbalance and also the parameters needed to be tuned.
After fixing the class imbalance and over sampling the model gave predictions with 98% accuracy.
